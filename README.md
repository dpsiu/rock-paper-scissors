# rock-paper-scissors

Applying what was learned into a project was immensely helpful. 
Many errors along the way, but that's progress.
Just difficult enough to be doable, yet challenging.

The experience with debugging, focusing on logic, console logs
    and being able to Google the right questions is much appreciated.

Can't wait for the next challenging project! 
The problem solving and logic was actually fun.
